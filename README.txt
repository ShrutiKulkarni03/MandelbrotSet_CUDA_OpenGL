HPP Seminar 2022 Demo --> OpenGL-CUDA Interop
---------------------------------------------

MANDELBROT SET
==============

Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers and one of the examples of FRACTALS. Fractals are the repeatative patterns in infinite scaling/magnification achieved with the help of mathematics. They are useful in modelling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation.
